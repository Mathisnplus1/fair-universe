# fair-universe

The Fair Universe project at LBNL is dedicated to creating an AI competition geared towards mitigating the impacts of systematic uncertainty in High Energy Physics. In the subsequent sections, we outline our perspective on the endeavor to establish a prototype competition. We compare two architectures for domain adversarial neural network : the two-branched architecture, that we have been working on, and an earlier architecture that was utilized within a comparable framework. Furthermore, we introduce an increased training framework for the two-branched architecture. Concluding our discussion, we offer a critique of the conventional approach taken in the comparison of such models.
